\title{Entry point for R to generate coral plot data from a set of association rules.}
\usage{
buildCoralPlots(
  rulesDF,
  grid_size,
  edge_gradient = as.character(c("#2c7bb6", "#d7191c")),
  edge_metric = "support",
  item_types = NULL,
  type_colors = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rulesDF}{A wide-format DataFrame representing association rules (as typically produced in R).}

\item{grid_size}{Number of grid cells per layout dimension to use during node positioning.}
}
\value{
A List containing two DataFrames:
\itemize{
   \item \code{edges}: DataFrame with start and end coordinates, line width, and color for each edge.
   \item \code{nodes}: DataFrame with position, radius, ID, and item label for each node.
}
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame of association rules and produces two data frames:
one for the nodes and one for the edges of a coral plot. It acts as a wrapper that:
\itemize{
   \item Converts the input R data frame to internal Rule objects.
   \item Constructs the coral layout by calling the lower-level `buildCoralPlots` function.
   \item Converts the resulting nodes and edges into R-compatible data frames.
}
}
