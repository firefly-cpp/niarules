\title{Evaluate a candidate solution, with optional time series filtering.}
\usage{
evaluate(solution, features, instances, is_time_series = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{solution}{A vector representing a candidate solution for the association rule.}

\item{features}{A list containing information about features, including type and bounds.}

\item{instances}{A data frame representing instances in the dataset.}

\item{is_time_series}{A boolean flag indicating if time series filtering is required.}
}
\value{
The fitness of the association rule and identified rule.
}
\description{
This function takes a candidate solution (vector), a list of features,
and instances. It evaluates the fitness of an association rule by calculating
support and confidence. If time series data is used, restrict evaluation
to the specified time range.
